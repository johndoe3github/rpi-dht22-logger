# rpi-dht22-logger

This is my first contribution to gihub. Over the years I have gleaned from other's projects and codes most thankfully. I thought maybe someone else could use a simple python script for a DHT22 sensor on a Raspberry Pi that I put together to log with a cron job every 10 minutes, which rotates every day for 365 days a year, for future reference.

This is running on my RPi2 with Ubuntu Mate 2020 LTS Image + AdaFruit package installed.

You should only have to edit your Home folder and sensor name in the script provided.

Sincerly hope this helps other beginners like me. 

PS: Do run this python script with sudo or equivalent super rights.
